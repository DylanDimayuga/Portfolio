                    <p>Hi, my name is Dylan Dimayuga. I was born August 28th, 1997. I was born and raised in Illinois as a Filipino American. 
                        Growing up, I always took an interest in technology, but I never thought of it as a career path. If you are not familiar, there is a general stereotype that Filipinos gravitate to the healthcare field. 
                        Well, I followed that stereotype and decided to pursue a career in Occupational Therapy. Later, I graduated college in 2019 with a Rehabilitation Sciences degree. It wasn't until I was trying to look for a job and planning on going to graduate school that I realized this career path wasn't for me.
                        This is when I decided to pursue an IT related career due to my early interest that never got fulfilled. To start, I got a job building servers, imaging computer, and basically configuring them the way a client wanted. This is when I realized I enjoyed building computers and decided to build my own, but
                        this wasn't enough, I didn't want to get stuck just putting the hardware together but wanted to get into the software side of things. Without any educational backgorund in the IT field, I did what I thought would be the best and I landed a IT Help Desk job at United Airlines.
                        This required me to know the programs they were working with, how to resolve issues with those programs, answer any IT related questions, etc. This still did not satisfy where I wanted my career path to go. So here I am, taking a Coding Bootcamp at Northwestern Illinois to see if Full Stack Web Development is the future I want.
