                    <p class="intro">Hi, my name is Dylan Dimayuga. I am currently taking the Northwestern Full Stack Web Developing Coding Bootcamp. I have taken interest into the front-end development of websites and have just started getting to learn back-end development.
                        After finishing this bootcamp, I hope to pursue a Web Developer role and become more proficient in building websites. So far, I find myself skilled in HTML and CSS, while being familiar with Javascript. I hope to become skilled in MySQL, jQuery, Heroku, API, and more.
                        This porfolio will see constant changes as I hone my skills, complete more projects, and learn.
